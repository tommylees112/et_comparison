Fresh from a year in Cambridge, we can confirm that the other place contributes no redeeming features to a persons character. Matt's character certainly hasn't improved.


After a series of Seconds appearances (some for the wrong side) our very own Pirate of the Carribbean has made the transition to the Blues Team. Like all good pirates Matt spends most of his time on water, enjoys playing with his sword and firing his load (sometimes on target). We even managed to get Matt on a horse. The coach, Andy, was particularly impressed with Matt's physique. He would sit and stare adoringly, telling every passer by, "those thighs, they're HUGE". It's crazy what a pair of jodphurs will do to a man. Andy will have to compete for Matt's admiration with a certain Antipodean member of the Womens team. Yet to be seen if we can put the man on four legs but we expect blistering physical events. His first Varsity match.
